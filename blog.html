                  <p class="card-text">It started well with me grasping the HTML and CSS for developing websites however the week ended with something new i.e<strong>BOOTSTRAP</strong>
                this erased all my GIT,HTML and CSS from my head for I was failing to understand it however afriend later explained to me what it does on <strong>friday 5:00pm</strong> 
            before leaving office and guess i now know Bootstrap. All that said these classes have been fun and very interactive, Excellent Lecturer and good coursemates</p>
